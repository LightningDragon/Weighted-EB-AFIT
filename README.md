# Weighted-EB-AFIT with maximum weight per container

This project is a modified version of https://github.com/LightningDragon/Weighted-EB-AFIT, which is based on https://github.com/davidmchapman/3DContainerPacking. It adds the functionality for setting a maximum weight for an container, which is sometimes useful if the delivery service has limits.
